# NodeJS Study
Hi there, this is a simple repository where I try to implement everything I can that I learned about NodeJS.

## Features

Currently, this repository has the following features:

- A simple CRUD to maintain users
- A simple CRUD to maintain places registered by users

For now I'm using the followeing technologies:
